# spring_blog_api

## Implement a restful blogging API using spring boot.

The structure of the blog is as follows: A blog belongs to a user who can modify itâ€™s contents through authentication. A blog is comprised of categories each which of is host to one or more posts. A post can be commented on by anyone and does not require authentication however only the owner of the blog can delete existing comments.

## Implementation
This application was developed using spring-boot framework (http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/), and its a REST backend for posts and comments on a blog. Every user on dabatase has its own blog, and its acessible through the endpoints. I based the implementation on spring-boot rest and security examples from https://github.com/royclarkson/spring-rest-service-oauth. 

## Installation
Steps to install and run the application. 
* Git clone it
* Install Java 8+ and Maven 3+
* Setup a folder to host file upload. There is a file called <strong>application.properties</strong> on /src/main/resources folder. Change the <strong>root_upload_file_path</strong> attribute to the folder you want. 
* Run <strong>mvn clean package install spring-boot:run</strong> on root folder
* This application will be available on http://localhost:8080

## Alternative installation
You can also run the application on a docker container:
* Install docker
* Build and run container image
`docker build -t spring_blo_api . && docker run -p 8080:8080 -t spring_blog_api`

## Usage
* With a running application, the first step is to authenticate:

`curl -X POST -vu clientapp:123456 http://localhost:8080/oauth/token -H "Accept: application/json" -d "password=spring&username=roy&grant_type=password&scope=read%20write&client_secret=123456&client_id=clientapp"`

If the authentication was succesfull, you are going to receive something like that

`{
  "access_token": "b98ed5b3-7c5f-4445-9298-74619824ca28",
  "token_type": "bearer",
  "refresh_token": "f554d386-0b0a-461b-bdb2-292831cecd57",
  "expires_in": 43199,
  "scope": "read write"
}`

* After authentication, you can create your posts. Posts creation requires authentication. 

`curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/posts -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer b98ed5b3-7c5f-4445-9298-74619824ca28" -d '{"title" : "title","category" : "category","content" : "content"}'`

* After that, you can navigate through your posts using pagination:

`curl -H "Accept: application/json" -X GET http://localhost:8080/posts/users/roy?page=0&size=0`

* Or access a specific post through its id:

`curl -H "Accept: application/json" -X GET http://localhost:8080/posts/1`

* You can add comments to any posts you want. If you send your authorization key, the comment will have your name on it. Otherwise, it will be anonymous. 

`curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/posts/1/comments -H "Accept: application/jAccept: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer b98ed5b3-7c5f-4445-9298-74619824ca28" -d '{"content" : "content"}'`

* You can also remove comments from YOUR posts, not from other user's posts

`curl -H "Authorization: Bearer b98ed5b3-7c5f-4445-9298-74619824ca28" -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/posts/1/comments/1`

* Files can also be added to posts, just like comments:

`curl -i -X POST -F name=file -F file=@/tmp/file.txt http://localhost:8080/posts/1/files`


`curl -i -X GET http://localhost:8080/posts/1/files/1`
